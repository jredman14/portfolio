# Changes made since Part 2
> Include few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part 2. 

To start, I uploaded my writing into Shorthand, then embedded my visualizations in the text. I also added a few pictures from Unsplash (no copyright) that depicted places in Northern Virginia (I checked the locations listed in the photo descriptions) to add another interesting visual element, and break up the very long stream of line graphs that my story contains. I added a few major design elements too: a choropleth map of Census block housing density in Fairfax, Arlington, and Loudoun Counties (I could not find data for Prince William County), a map showing the growth of impervious surfaces in Los Angeles County, California from 2001 to 2021, and a new section showing a definition of urban sprawl from a quote by [John Rafferty](https://www.britannica.com/explore/savingearth/urban-sprawl). 

I added the choropleth map after my interviews, when one interviewee suggested that housing density could help provide more context to my discussion of sprawl. 

## The audience

Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).

## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story.

# Final thoughts
> You can summarize any final thoughts / reflections that don't fit well in the previous sections here.  How did it go?  What did you run out of time for, or wish you had a chance to revisit?  What were you most excited about?  Include any final reflections as you think they might help us understand your process.  If you already included such reflections elsewhere, you can delete this section.
