# My Final Data Story
> Include a link to your final data story on Shorthand, Esri StoryMaps, etc. here. 

# Changes Made Since Part 2
> Include few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part 2. 

To start, I uploaded my writing into Shorthand, then embedded my visualizations in the text. I also added a few pictures from Unsplash (no copyright) that depicted places in Northern Virginia (I checked the locations listed in the photo descriptions) to add another interesting visual element, and break up the very long stream of line graphs that my story contains. I added a few major design elements too: a choropleth map of Census block housing density in Fairfax, Arlington, and Loudoun Counties (I could not find data for Prince William County), a map showing the growth of impervious surfaces in Los Angeles County, California from 2001 to 2021, and a new section showing a definition of urban sprawl from a quote by [John Rafferty](https://www.britannica.com/explore/savingearth/urban-sprawl). 

I added the choropleth map after my interviews, when one interviewee suggested that housing density could help provide more context to my discussion of sprawl. After the in-class critique, I added the Los Angeles case study, when one of my classmates noted that my presentation lacked the context necessary to make sense of my facts and figures and suggested some other municipality to compare against. The definition section was based on feedback from an interviewee, saying that I needed to define some of my jargon for the average reader. Even though I did not intend for the audience to be the general public (more on that later), I thought that adding a definition could make the overall design less monotonous and more interesting. 

I also tweaked some of my narrative, mostly to soften my conclusion a bit - I didn't want to imply that development should only occur in the inner suburbs, I mainly intended to drive the point home that development should be mostly limited to the current impervious footprint. We can't undo previous development, but we can make our current urban footprint more dense, walkable, and connected over time. 

I also changed the colors of my lines on my line graphs - in Part 2, each individual county line was gray so that the mean/sum line could stand out for each measure. However my interviewees said that it was very difficult to make any meaningful comparison between individual counties when all the lines were gray. I didn't figure out how to make all but one line more transparent, but I was able to give each county a different color while widening the mean/sum line for each graph. This way, readers can compare and contrast the measures for each county, but the overall trend line stood out. 

## The Audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

# Final Thoughts
> You can summarize any final thoughts / reflections that don't fit well in the previous sections here.  How did it go?  What did you run out of time for, or wish you had a chance to revisit?  What were you most excited about?  Include any final reflections as you think they might help us understand your process.  If you already included such reflections elsewhere, you can delete this section.
