# Wireframes / storyboards
Northern Virginia is a dynamic area - as my hometown, I've been witness to a lot of the growth the area has seen in the past two decades. From intense development in the ex-urbs, to new toll roads and train stations, and huge lifestyle centers being built, NOVA continues to change - not always for the better. Ultimately, I want to use the following metrics to argue for a more sustainable, compact development structure.

## Northern Virginia Continues to Grow in Population

**Fairfax is still the largest county by far, but outer-ring counties like Loudoun and Prince William are far outpacing more dense Arlington County in population growth.**

## Incomes have continued to rise throughout the area

**Loudoun County outpaces the other counties in the region significantly, though all have a median income of $100,000 or more.**

## But poverty rate has not seen an equivalent drop, so not everyone is sharing in the wealth.

**Arlington has seen a poverty rate as high as 8.5% in the past decade, even as incomes continue to rise.**

## Despite the overall population growth and higher wages, home ownership rate has lagged in the past decade.

**All counties had a lower percentage of residents owning their homes in 2022 than in 2009, with the overall trend being stagnant.**

## Perhaps that can be partially explained by the lower number of building permits for residences being issued.

**The number of permits issued has dropped significantly since a peak near the 21st century (driven by Fairfax, Loudoun and Prince William, Arlington has typically issued fewer building permits).**

## Declines in commute times and car-commuting can be seen post-2020, however Census Data suggests that this was mostly due to increased work-from-home, rather than significant increases in alternative forms of transportation.**

**It makes sense that commute times would drop, given the increased number of people working from home - especially since the trends in both graphs below seemed to shift at about the same time. Given that, I believe the pre-2020 numbers provide a more accurate picture of the area trends. The areas remain car dependent overall.**

## Overall, the population level statistics I have analyzed lead me to believe that, even though the counties continue to grow in population and incomes continue to increase, given the stagnant poverty and home-ownership rates, decreased levels of home-building, and the reliance on cars, the development patterns of NOVA are not sustainable.

**As you'll see in the figures below, the overall impervious footprint in NOVA has increased significantly in the past two decades. This "sprawl" is associated with "increased energy use, pollution, and traffic congestion and a decline in community distinctiveness and cohesiveness," according to [Encyclopædia Brittanica's *Saving Earth* project](https://www.britannica.com/explore/savingearth/urban-sprawl).**

Overall, it is critical that NOVA does not continue down this development path. Based on the data analysis above, I believe it is crucial to focus on infill housing and commercial development in Arlington and the denser portions of Fairfax, rather than outlying areas in Loudoun and Prince William. This change in overall planning strategy will help create a more sustainable and livable future for NOVA residents. 

# User research 

## Target audience
My main audience is policymakers and the public in Northern Virginia. I ultimately would want this project to shine a light on poor patterns of development in the area, and promote more infill development in areas like Arlington and the inner-ring suburbs of Fairfax. To best capture my target audience, I asked people I know that have grown up in NOVA or have spent a significant amount of time there. 

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Find blind spots in analysis | Given your knowledge of the area, is there anything notable you think I missed? What other population level statistics would have been useful in explaning the development patterns of the area? |
| Determine clarity | Did the overall points of the narrative come across well? Would you have been able to understand the general point of the narrative without the text I included with the visualization? Did the visualizations themselves come across clearly? |
| Next steps | What visualizations that I didn't include here would you recommend including? Is there any form of analysis that would make the analysis more persuasive? |


## Interview findings
> Detail the findings from your interviews.  Do not include PII.  Capture specific insights where possible.

| Questions | Interview 1 (civil engineer, mid 20s, NOVA resident | Interview 2 (product manager, mid 20s, NOVA resident | Interview 3 (freelance creative, mid 20s, spent time in NOVA)|
|-----------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Given your knowledge of the area, is there anything notable you think I missed? | Could look into transit development in the area to see how that's impacted car dependency (though it seems like maybe it hasn't) | Data on jobs - corporations like Amazon coming to area have brought a lot of new development | More about people who work from home, since they seemed to impact the analysis quite a bit |
| What other population level statistics would have been useful in explaning the development patterns of the area? | Housing density in the area could be another interesting metric for measuring sprawl | Mean home size, frequency that people move, how often people lease out their homes - would be interesting to see if trends are due to people getting evicted, people downsizing, people buying second properties, etc. | Again, more about behaviors of people working from home |
| Did the overall points of the narrative come across well? | Overall was good, but would be good to emphasize the connection between building permits and sustainability - didn't see the relationship there | "Yeah!" | "Yes" |
| Would you have been able to understand the general point of the narrative without the text I included with the visualization? | The visualizations did mostly "stand on their own" | Only the impervious surface map would have required some explanation | The text seemed necessary to see what was going on |
| Did the visualizations themselves come across clearly? | Would be good to make the county lines different colors to they're easier to distinguish from each other and maybe make the mean/total line different on each graph if I want it to stand out | "Yes, fairly intuitive and easy to digest." | "The visuals were clear enough." |
| What visualizations that I didn't include here would you recommend including? | Housing density heat map | Some visualization that depicts what the characteristics of the typical/average person in the area | Would be good to add some definitions for words that the "layman" might not understand well |
| Is there any form of analysis that would make the analysis more persuasive? | Housing density analysis | Speak to what the result would be if trends continued and describe what I mean by "livable." | Financial figures that might support the analysis |

## Critique findings
The main thing that came out of the critique was that it would be useful to include a comparison to another place that has developed more sustainably, so the outcomes could seem more concrete. I thought that was a good idea, so I'm planning on including that in part 3.

# Identified changes for Part III

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| More data on housing density and trends would help support the analysis | Could be interesting to make a heat map of housing density, assuming the data is available - it would be another indicator of sprawl that would pair well with the impervious surface map. |
| More data on job trends and work from home would help support the analysis | These data points might be a tad too specific and small-sample-size, respectively, to make a visualization work (job data can be difficult to obtain when you're talking about specific companies and work-from-home is still quite new as a significant factor in the analysis). I will look into my options, though, and see what I can gather. |
| The gray lines blend together too much and make county comparisons difficult | I did intentionally gray those out to make the mean and total lines appear more prominent, however I think using different colors but with some transparancy for the county lines might be better - I'll make that change. |
| My dicussion on livability was a bit half baked - put more into discussing how each of the factors contribute to better or worse livability | I'll write a bit more and incorporate some more research into the final to support my points here, and make the connections between metrics like home building and sustainability/livability more clear (that does require a bit of explanation about density, home prices, etc.). I'll also write a bit more about the consequences of inaction, which should help as a storytelling device as well. Possibly making a simple infographic about what the characteristics of the average person, as one of my interviewees suggested, could help bring context here too. |
| Defititions of challenging words could be useful | Definitions can also be cool from a design standpoint too, which could help improve the aesthetic of the final Shorthand page, I'll add some definitions to the final. |
| A comparison case would help drive home points | I'll look into other suburban areas that have been more successful in sustainable development and make a compare/contrast section. |

Overall, I think this feedback helps a lot, and I feel pretty good heading into the final part of the project (though getting through all of this in a minute could be tough!).
