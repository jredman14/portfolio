# My Telling Stories with Data Portfolio
My portfolio of projects created in my Telling Stories with Data course at CMU.

# About me
Hi! My name is Justin, and I'm currently a student in the Public Policy and Management graduate program at the Heinz College. My main policy interests are in urban planning and economic development, especially in a regional context. I have a background in writing, data analysis, and a deep passion for all things maps - when I'm not exploring the transit layer of Google Maps, I'm probably on ArcGIS messing around with a new dataset. 

I'm excited to be able to share my work with you, and I hope my projects are informative or interesting in some way - thank you for visiting my page!

# What I hope to learn
In this course, I'm looking forward to learning how to use Tableau, creating effective data visualizations for the web, and finding ways to apply these skills toward my career aspirations and other interests.
